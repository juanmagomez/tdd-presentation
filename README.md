tdd-presentation
================

This TDD presentation was used at OdigeO Madrid in July 2012. I wrote it in order to introduce my team the test driven design world. 

It is developed using impress.js (https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/)

Feel free to use it for your own non comercial purposes. I hope it will be useful for you! :D
